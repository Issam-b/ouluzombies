# OuluZombies
OuluZombies is a small desktop game (PC/Linux) about zombies invading the city of Oulu in Finland. The game is a third person fighting game, with a main player fighting zombies. There's few animations and NPCs to interact with, as well as two final bosses at the end.

The game is built using Unity 2017.2.0f2 for the 3D virtual environment course in University of Oulu. The models of the city of Oulu used, along side with few models from [Mixamo website](https://www.mixamo.com/) and some modeled models.

Due to the big size of the game folder, we have only the game builds on this repo along with a short preview video for the game, so feel free to download the game for windows or linux and try it.

**NOTE:** Please uncompress the zips to play the game.
